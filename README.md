# My first website using HTML and CSS

This is my first website and it was built using plain HTML5 and CSS3

Apparently I am new in the tech world and I was able to build this website with the help of a course - CODE WITH MOSH.
The course was really helpful because i learnt a lot of HTML5 basics such as positioning elements, how to use grid. I also learnt basic styling using CSS along with other things.

I am really happy to have wrapped up this course because I am looking forward to learning other things as related to tech and web-development.
